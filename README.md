# CONSOLE APPLICATION : pause_for

## Project Overview

A simple Windows ONLY application to 'pause' for the number of 
seconds given on the command line.

20140425: Changed to a cmake build in the 'build' directory
And make lots of other changes for inputing a decimal seconds value...

To build the project  
cd build  
build-me

Install the resultant EXE in a directory in your PATH

Original app was created by MSVC10 AppWizard...
